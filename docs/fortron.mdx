# Fortron

Fortron is a form of energy that MFFS machines use as a source of power. It is produced and stored initially by the
[](@mffs:coercion_deriver) to then be transferred to other machines by the [](@mffs:fortron_capacitor).

Another source of Fortron energy is a creative-only item known as the Infinite Power Card.
It can be placed directly into a [](@mffs:fortron_capacitor) (left most item slot) to provide an infinite supply of Fortron.

Fortron is able to exist as a liquid.
It may be pumped directly from a [Capacitor](@mffs:fortron_capacitor) and manipulated in the same way [Water](@water) or
[Lava](@lava) can.
