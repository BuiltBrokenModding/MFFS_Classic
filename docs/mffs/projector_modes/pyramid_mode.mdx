By default, the Pyramid Mode sets the Projector to generate a force field in a pyramid-like shape. The thickness of the
pyramid-like shape depends on its size.

Each Scale Module increases the size of the field by 1 block in all directions.

## Field adjustment

Placing a Scale Module into an item slot marked by a directional arrow has a different effect. A module placed in either
the left, right, front or back item slots will scale the field by 1 block in both opposing directions at the same time.

Placing a module in either the up or down item slots will scale the field by 1 block only in that direction.

For example, to increase the height of a force field by 1 block; add a Scale Module into an item slot marked by a
directional arrow pointing towards the top-left or top-right of the GUI screen.
