Fortron is a form of energy that MFFS machines use as a source of power. It is produced and stored initially by the
Coercion Deriver to then be transferred to other machines by the Fortron Capacitor.

Another source of Fortron energy is a creative-only item known as the Infinite Power Card.
It can be placed directly into a Fortron Capacitor (left most item slot) to provide an infinite supply of Fortron.

Fortron is able to exist as a liquid.
It may be pumped directly from a Capacitor and manipulated in the same way Water or Lava can.
