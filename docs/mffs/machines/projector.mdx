The Force Field Projector is a fundamental part of the MFFS family of machines.
It uses Fortron energy to project force fields of various shapes and sizes into the world.

## Usage

To make a force field, give the Force Field Projector a supply of [Fortron](../getting_started/fortron) by linking it
to a nearby Fortron Capacitor.

This can be achieved either by:
- Right-clicking the Force Field Projector and entering the matching frequency number into its GUI screen
- Shift-right-clicking the Projector while holding a Frequency Card.

Decide which force field shape to create by crafting one of the projector mode items.
Right-click the Projector and place the projector mode item into the central (red) slot surrounded by outwardly
facing arrows.

Craft a number of Scale Module items and place them into the left-hand slot matrix of the Force Field Projector's GUI.
Each Scale Module used in the Projector's matrix slots will increase the force field radius by one block.

The number at the bottom of the GUI indicates how much Fortron is required to sustain a force field of the specified
size and shape. Activate the Projector by supplying it with a Redstone signal. Once activated, the Force Field Projector
will change from red to blue and begin projecting a force field (assuming it has enough available Fortron).

To be able to walk through a force field, a Biometric Identifier is needed.

## Upgradability

A Force Field Projector may be augmented with various modules.

These general modules have the following effects:

- Scale Module: Adjusts the shape of a projected force field
- Speed Module: Allows the Projector to generate a force field more quickly
- Capacity Module: Increases the amount of Fortron the Projector is able to store
