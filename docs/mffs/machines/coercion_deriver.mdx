The Coercion Deriver is a member of the MFFS family of machines.
It is primarily used to generate Fortron from FE energy, which other MFFS machines require to function.
A Coercion Deriver is designed to work in conjunction with a Fortron Capacitor to charge it with Fortron.

Fortron is then distributed to the other machines by the Capacitor.

## Usage

To generate Fortron, connect the Coercion Deriver to a FE source and activate it using a Redstone signal.
Once powered and activated, the Coercion Deriver will change from red to blue and begin generating Fortron.

A Coercion Deriver may be linked to other MFFS machines, such as a Fortron Capacitor, by setting its frequency number
to match that of the other machines.

This can be achieved by either:

- Right-clicking the Deriver and entering the desired frequency number into its GUI screen
- Shift-right-clicking the Coercion Deriver while holding a Frequency Card

The Coercion Deriver's ability to generate Fortron can be amplified using Lapis Lazuli or Nether Quartz.
For this, place either into the slot next to the arrow. This should increase Fortron output by about 20x.

## Operation Modes

The Coercion Deriver has two modes of operation: Derive and Integrate.
By default, it is set to Derive - meaning it steadily converts supplied FE into Fortron.

Clicking the Derive toggle button in the middle of the GUI screen switches its operating mode to Integrate
and vice versa. In Integrate mode, the Deriver operates in reverse by converting available Fortron back into FE.

## Upgradability

A Coercion Deriver may be augmented with various modules to improve its performance.

- Speed Module: Increases the boosting effect gained when inserting Lapis Lazuli or Nether Quartz into the Deriver
- Capacity Module: Increases the amount of Fortron the Deriver is able to store
