The Fortron Capacitor serves as an energy storage and management device for MFFS machines.
It's designed to collect Fortron generated by Coercion Derivers and transfer it to other machines that need Fortron to
operate, essentially acting as a "hub".

## Usage

Place the Capacitor and set which frequency it should use. By default, Capacitors use frequency number 0, but this can
be changed either by:

- Right-clicking the Capacitor and entering the desired frequency number into its GUI
- Shift-right-clicking the Capacitor while holding a Frequency Card

Activate the Fortron Capacitor by supplying it with a Redstone signal. Once activated, the Capacitor will change from
red to blue and begin transferring Fortron between other MFFS devices that use the same frequency and are within range
(15 blocks by default).

## Upgradability

A Fortron Capacitor may be augmented with various modules to enhance its capabilities:

- Scale Module: Enables the Capacitor to link with other MFFS machines over a larger distance Each module increases the
range by 1 block from the default of 15 blocks
- Speed Module: Allows the Capacitor to transfer Fortron to and from machines more quickly. Each module increases the
transfer rate by 50 FE
- Capacity Module: Increases the amount of Fortron the Capacitor is able to store
