The Biometric Identifier is a member of the MFFS family of machines. It uses bio-signatures given off by players to
govern what permissions they have when interacting with force fields and MFFS machines.

For example, it can allow a player to pass through an active force field, or exempt them from the effects of the
Interdiction Matrix.

## Usage

To configure the Biometric Identifier to recognise a player, open its GUI screen and place an Identification Card into
the top-left item slot labeled Rights. If the Identification Card is blank and hasn't already been assigned, you can
either shift-right-click while holding it in your hand to assign it to yourself, or shift-right-click another player
to assign it to them.

Next, set which permissions you wish the player to have by toggling the buttons on the right side of the GUI.

Each button assigns the following permission:
- **Warp**: Permit the player to bypass force fields by sneaking through them.
- **Block Alter**: Allow the player to place or break blocks while standing inside the area protected by the Interdiction
Matrix.
- **Block Access**: Let the player open the GUI screen of anything while standing inside the Matrix's operational range.
- **Configure**: Grant the player access to configure the Biometric Identifier and change user permissions.
- **Bypass Defense**: Allow the player to bypass restrictions enforced by the Interdiction Matrix.
- **Bypass Confiscation**: Exempt the player from the confiscation effect of the Interdiction Matrix.
- **Remote Control**: Permit the player to use a remote control on machines linked to the Identifier.

With the player's rights now assigned, move their card into any of the 9 slots along the bottom of the GUI screen to
complete the process. To set yourself as the master of a Biometric Identifier, place an Identification Card assigned to
you into the item slot labeled Master.


The master user of a Biometric Identifier is automatically granted all permissions. Enable the Biometric Identifier by
applying a Redstone signal or by clicking the Redstone Torch button in the top-left corner of its GUI. Once activated,
the Biometric Identifier will light up and take effect.

## Notes

While warping through a force field, a player must keep sneaking until they have fully exited the field barrier,
otherwise they'll be killed.

Identification Cards can't be removed from the Identifier while it's active.

Passing through a force field can cause temporary Nausea IV.

A player in creative mode can always warp through a force field.
