The Anti-Spawn Module is an optional module for the Interdiction Matrix. With this module installed, the Matrix will
prevent hostile or friendly entities from spawning within its action area. If a player posseses a spawn egg, standing
just outside the action range of the Matrix will let them spawn the entity inside the protected region.
