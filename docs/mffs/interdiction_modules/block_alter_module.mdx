The Block Alter Module is an optional module for the Interdiction Matrix. It enables a Matrix to inhibit a player's
ability to place or break blocks. If a player tries to break or place a block that falls within the action area of the
Interdiction Matrix, it will inform the player that they do not have permission to do this and then reverse whatever
they may have done.
