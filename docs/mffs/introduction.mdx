Modular Force Field Systems (MFFS) is a mod that adds force fields, high tech machinery and defensive measures to
Minecraft.

Ever tired of nuclear explosions blowing up your house or want to keep people out of your secret bases?
Say no more, we've got you covered!

Force fields can be used for a myriad of things, including:

- Keeping intruders out of your house
- Building structures
- Creating underwater bases or airlocks
- Exterminating approaching mobs
- Capturing enemies in traps
- Protecting against ballistic missiles
- Confiscating items from players

MFFS also features configuration options that can remove its dependency on electrical energy, making it usable within
vanilla Minecraft or in combination with other mods. MFFS is most commonly used in multi-player worlds,
but certainly provides many benefits for single-player as well.
