The Camouflage Module can be used in a Force Field Projector to alter the appearance of the force field itself.
With a Camouflage Module installed, force fields may be disguised as regular blocks. For example, a force field might
be masked as a wall of Stone. The Camouflage Module can be used in combination with all Projector Modes.

## Usage

This feature of the Projector can help players to hide things from other people or camouflage the entrance to a secret
base. Select a block you wish to use as camouflage and place it in another empty slot of the Projector's left-hand
item matrix (the same matrix as the Camouflage Module). Activate the Projector in the usual way.
