The Stabilization Module may be used in a Force Field Projector to crystallise the field into a solid form. Instead of
creating an energy field barrier that disappears when it is turned off, the Projector replaces the field with real
blocks supplied by the player.

In this manner, the Stabilization Module makes it possible to produce an exact physical replica of a force field pattern
that remains after the Projector is deactivated. Because the field is constructed using actual blocks, its durability
corresponds to that of the blocks. However, as long as the Projector is sufficiently powered and supplied with enough
replacement blocks, it will continually regenerate the field structure if it is broken.

The stabilization (transposition) process requires more Fortron and is slower than normal field projection; but if used
in combination with the Custom Mode feature of a Projector, its conceivable applications are virtually limitless.

For example, a player could create a structure that was automatically repaired whenever a Creeper tried to blow it up.
Adding Speed Modules into a Projector allows multiple blocks to be stabilized at once.

## Usage

- Place a chest next to the Force Field Projector (any side) and make sure it contains the required blocks to build
the field up.
- Insert a Field Stabilization Module into the Projector's matrix slots. Set up the field as your wish and then activate
the Projector.
- The Projector will consume blocks from adjacent chests in the order that they appear. If a chest contains a mixture
of different blocks, the target structure will also be composed of a block mixture.

## Custom mode usage

Unlike the other modes available for the Force Field Projector, the Custom Mode item stores the precise position and
type of each block it analyses. As a result, the stabilization process for the Custom Mode does not work in the same way.
Instead of consuming blocks in their order of appearance and transposing them to arbitrary locations; the Projector will
take only the block types that match the original pattern.

Each block is placed exactly as it should be according to its type and position. If a Projector runs out of the matching
block types necessary to replicate a pattern, it will pause until they are provided.
