The Frequency Card can hold, memorize and generate frequencies for interacting with machines. Its frequency can be set
by placing it into a machine's frequency slot. Using it on any machine will set the frequency of that machine to
whatever is set on the card. You can generate a random frequency by shift-right-clicking while holding the card.
