# Force Field Projector

The Force Field Projector is a fundamental part of the MFFS family of machines.
It uses []($fortron) energy to project force fields of various shapes and sizes into the world.

<PrefabObtaining />

## Usage

To make a force field, give the Force Field Projector a supply of []($fortron) by linking it
to a nearby [](@mffs:fortron_capacitor).

This can be achieved either by:
- Right-clicking the Force Field Projector and entering the matching frequency number into its GUI screen
- Shift-right-clicking the Projector while holding a [](@mffs:frequency_card).

Decide which force field shape to create by crafting one of the projector mode items.
Right-click the Projector and place the projector mode item into the central (red) slot surrounded by outwardly
facing arrows.

Craft a number of [](@mffs:scale_module) items and place them into the left-hand slot matrix of the Force Field Projector's
GUI. Each [](@mffs:scale_module) used in the Projector's matrix slots will increase the force field radius by one block.

The number at the bottom of the GUI indicates how much []($fortron) is required to sustain a force field of the
specified size and shape. Activate the Projector by supplying it with a [Redstone](@minecraft:redstone) signal.

Once activated, the Force Field Projector will change from red to blue and begin projecting a force field
(assuming it has enough available Fortron).

To be able to walk through a force field, a [](@mffs:biometric_identifier) is needed.

## Upgradability

A Force Field Projector may be augmented with various modules.

These general modules have the following effects:

- [](@mffs:scale_module): Adjusts the shape of a projected force field
- [](@mffs:speed_module): Allows the Projector to generate a force field more quickly
- [](@mffs:capacity_module): Increases the amount of Fortron the Projector is able to store
