The Disintegration Module can be used in a Force Field Projector to alter the effect a force field has on its
surroundings. Placing a Disintegration Module into a Projector's matrix slots will cause the field it generates to
break any blocks that are obstructing it. Broken blocks are dropped as items and can be picked up.

## Usage

The Disintegration Module is compatible with all projector modes and can be used to reverse the effect of the 
Field Stabilizer Module. Adding Speed Modules into a Projector allows multiple blocks to be disintegrated at once.
It can also be combined with a Collection Module to automatically pick up broken blocks.
