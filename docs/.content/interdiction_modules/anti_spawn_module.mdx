# Anti-Spawn Module

The Anti-Spawn Module is an optional module for the Interdiction Matrix.

<PrefabObtaining />

## Effect

With this module installed, the Matrix will prevent hostile or friendly entities from spawning within its action area.

If a player posseses a spawn egg, standing just outside the action range of the Matrix will let them spawn the entity
inside the protected region.
