The Block Access Module is an optional module for the Interdiction Matrix. It enables a Matrix to inhibit a player's
ability to right-click on a block and access its GUI screen.

## Operation

If an unauthorized player tries to right-click a block or machine located within the action range of an Interdiction
Matrix (equipped with the Block Access Module), they will not be permitted to open its GUI. As we would expect, blocks
or machines outside the action area can be used normally.
