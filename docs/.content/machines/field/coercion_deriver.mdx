# Coercion Deriver

The Coercion Deriver is a member of the MFFS family of machines.
It is primarily used to generate []($fortron) from FE energy, which other MFFS machines require to function.
The Coercion Deriver is designed to work in conjunction with a [](@mffs:fortron_capacitor) to charge it with 
[]($fortron).

[]($fortron) is then distributed to the other machines by the [Capacitor](@mffs:fortron_capacitor).

## Usage

To generate []($fortron), connect the Coercion Deriver to a FE source and activate it using a [Redstone](@redstone)
signal. Once powered and activated, the Coercion Deriver will change from red to blue and begin generating []($fortron).

A Coercion Deriver may be linked to other MFFS machines, such as a [](@mffs:fortron_capacitor), by setting its
frequency number to match that of the other machines.

This can be achieved by either:

- Right-clicking the Deriver and entering the desired frequency number into its GUI screen
- Shift-right-clicking the Coercion Deriver while holding a [](@mffs:frequency_card)

The Coercion Deriver's ability to generate []($fortron) can be amplified using [Lapis Lazuli](@lapis_lazuli) or
[Nether Quartz](@nether_quartz).
For this, place either into the slot next to the arrow. This should increase []($fortron) output by about 20x.

## Operation Modes

The Coercion Deriver has two modes of operation: Derive and Integrate.
By default, it is set to Derive - meaning it steadily converts supplied FE into []($fortron).

Clicking the Derive toggle button in the middle of the GUI screen switches its operating mode to Integrate
and vice versa. In Integrate mode, the Deriver operates in reverse by converting available []($fortron) back into FE.

## Upgradability

A Coercion Deriver may be augmented with various modules to improve its performance.

- [](@mffs:speed_module): Increases the boosting effect gained when inserting [Lapis Lazuli](@lapis_lazuli) or
[Nether Quartz](@nether_quartz) into the Deriver
- [](@mffs:capacity_module): Increases the amount of []($fortron) the Deriver is able to store
