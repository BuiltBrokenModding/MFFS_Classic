# Fortron Capacitor

The Fortron Capacitor serves as an energy storage and management device for MFFS machines.
It's designed to collect []($fortron) generated by [Coercion Derivers](@mffs:coercion_deriver) and transfer it to other
machines that need []($fortron) to operate, essentially acting as a "hub".

## Usage

Place the Capacitor and set which frequency it should use. By default, Capacitors use frequency number 0, but this can
be changed either by:

- Right-clicking the Capacitor and entering the desired frequency number into its GUI
- Shift-right-clicking the Capacitor while holding a [](@mffs:frequency_card)

Activate the Fortron Capacitor by supplying it with a Redstone signal. Once activated, the Capacitor will change from
red to blue and begin transferring Fortron between other MFFS devices that use the same frequency and are within range
(15 blocks by default).

## Upgradability

A Fortron Capacitor may be augmented with various modules to enhance its capabilities:

- [](@mffs:scale_module): Enables the Capacitor to link with other MFFS machines over a larger distance Each module increases the
range by 1 block from the default of 15 blocks
- [](@mffs:speed_module): Allows the Capacitor to transfer []($fortron) to and from machines more quickly. Each module increases the
transfer rate by 50 FE
- [](@mffs:capacity_module): Increases the amount of []($fortron) the Capacitor is able to store
