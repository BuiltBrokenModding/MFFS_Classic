# Cube Mode

By default, the Cube Mode sets the [Projector](mffs:projector) to generate a force field in the shape of a cube that is
exactly 1 block thick.

Each [](@mffs:scale_module) increases the size of the force field by 1 block in all directions.

## Field adjustment

The Cube Mode item can also be used to create cuboid (or right rectangular prism) shape force fields. Placing a 
[](@mffs:scale_module) into an item slot marked by a directional arrow will scale the field by 1 block in only that
direction.

For example, to increase the height of a force field by 1 block; add a [](@mffs:scale_module) into an item slot marked
by a directional arrow pointing towards the top-left or top-right of the GUI screen.
