# Cylinder Mode

By default, the Cylinder Mode sets the [Projector](@mffs:projector) to generate a force field in the shape of a
cylinder that is exactly 1 block thick. Each [](mffs:scale_module) increases the size of the force field by 1 block in
the target direction.

<PrefabObtaining />

## Field adjustment

Placing a [](mffs:scale_module) into an item slot marked by a directional arrow will scale the field by 1 block in only
that direction.
For example, to increase the height of a force field by 1 block; add a Scale Module into an item slot marked by a
directional arrow pointing towards the top-left or top-right of the GUI screen.
