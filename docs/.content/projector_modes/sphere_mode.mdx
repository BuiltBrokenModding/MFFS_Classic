# Sphere Mode

By default, the Sphere Mode sets the Projector to generate a force field in the shape of a sphere that is exactly 1
block thick.

Each Scale Module increases the size of the force field by 1 block.

## Field adjustment

Adding Scale Modules to item slots marked with a directional arrow further increases the radius of the force field by 1
block per module.
