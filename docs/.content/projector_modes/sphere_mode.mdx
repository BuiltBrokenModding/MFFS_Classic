# Sphere Mode

By default, the Sphere Mode sets the [Projector](@mffs:projector) to generate a force field in the shape of a sphere
that is exactly 1 block thick.

Each [](mffs:scale_module) increases the size of the force field by 1 block.

## Field adjustment

Adding [Scale Modules](mffs:scale_module) to item slots marked with a directional arrow further increases the radius of
the force field by 1 block per module.
