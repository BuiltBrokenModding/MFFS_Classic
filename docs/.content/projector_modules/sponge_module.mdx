# Sponge Module

Placing a Sponge Module in a Force Field Projector makes it continually detect and remove any fluids contained within
the field. The rate at which fluids are removed can be increased by installing Speed Modules. Higher rates may be needed
for removing infinite fluids, such as Water.
