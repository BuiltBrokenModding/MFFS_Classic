# Sponge Module

Placing a Sponge Module in a [](@mffs:projector) makes it continually detect and remove any fluids contained within
the field. The rate at which fluids are removed can be increased by installing [Speed Modules](@mffs:speed_module).
Higher rates may be needed for removing infinite fluids, such as [Water](@mffs:water).
