# Disintegration Module

The Disintegration Module can be used in a [](@mffs:projector) to alter the effect a force field has on its
surroundings. Placing a Disintegration Module into a Projector's matrix slots will cause the field it generates to
break any blocks that are obstructing it. Broken blocks are dropped as items and can be picked up.

## Usage

The Disintegration Module is compatible with all projector modes and can be used to inverse the effect of the 
[](mffs:stabilization_module).
Adding [Speed Modules](@mffs:speed_module) into a Projector allows multiple blocks to be disintegrated at once.
It can also be combined with a [](@mffs:collection_module) to automatically pick up broken blocks.
