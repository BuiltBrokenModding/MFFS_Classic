# Glow Module

The Glow Module can be used in a [](@mffs:projector) to illuminate the area around the field.

Installing Glow Modules into a Projector makes the force field emit light. As more Glow Modules are added
(up to a maximum of 64), the field's brightness increases - until it becomes equal to that of Glowstone.
