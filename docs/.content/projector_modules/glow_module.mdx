The Glow Module can be used in a Force Field Projector to illuminate the area around the field. Installing Glow Modules
into a Projector makes the force field emit light. As more Glow Modules are added (up to a maximum of 64), the field's
brightness increases - until it becomes equal to that of Glowstone.
