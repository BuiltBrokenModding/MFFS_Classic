Once a user-defined block pattern has been analysed and stored by the $(2)Custom Mode$() item itself, the Projector is able to generate a force field that is an $(9)exact replica$() of the original. In this manner, force fields may be constructed in the shape of $(9)anything that can be crafted$() - including a bridge, a house, or even an entire fortress!"
