A $(5)Remote Controller$() does not need to be charged; it draws energy directly from a nearby MFFS machine using the same frequency. As such, a Remote cannot function if there is insufficient $(l:mffs:getting_started/fortron)Fortron$() available."

The controller will display the name and coordinates of the machine it has linked with. $(li)Walk away from the machine and right-click with the remote to access the machine's GUI."
