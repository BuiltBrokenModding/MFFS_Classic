## About

**Modular Force Field System** (or MFFS) is a mod that adds force fields, high tech machinery and defensive measures to
Minecraft.
Ever tired of nuclear explosions blowing up your house or want to keep people out of your secret bases?
**May the force (fields) be with you!**

MFFS v3.0+ is a complete ground-up rewrite inspired by ThunderDark's MFFS mod.

Downloads can be found on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mffs).

## Usage

MFFS uses Fortron as its main power source for force fields. It contains a series of machines focused on converting
energy to Forton for the use
in generating force fields. The primary machine is the Force Field Projector which is powered by Fortron Capacitors
(storage) and Coercion Derivers (generators).

The projector can be modified with various cards and upgrades that improve its stats. These upgrades include several
field shapes, size scaling,
position offset, and utility modules. For example, the upgrade to shock attacks, kill monsters, remove blocks, and
protect tiles.

### Status
